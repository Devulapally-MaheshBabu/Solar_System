## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

> 💡 **No frameworks needed** — just basic HTML + JS + Three.js

### ✅ Prerequisites

- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- A local server (recommended)
  - You can use VSCode with Live Server
  - Or use Python/Node to serve files

### 💻 Method 1: Using VSCode + Live Server

1. Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code**
2. Install the **Live Server** extension (if not already)
3. Right-click on `index.html` and click `Open with Live Server`
4. Your default browser will open with the solar system running
