## Features

- Realistic orbiting and rotating planets
- Moon orbiting Earth
- Saturn and Uranus rings
- Individual speed controls for each planet
- Global speed control
- Toggleable orbit paths
- Touch controls for rotation and zoom
- Optimized for mobile and desktop

## How to Run Locally

>  **No frameworks needed** — just basic HTML + JS + Three.js

### Prerequisites

- A modern browser 
- A local server (recommended)
  - You can use VSCode with Live Server
  - Or use Python/Node to serve files

---

### Method 1: Using VSCode + Live Server

1. Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code**
2. Install the **Live Server** extension (if not already)
3. Right-click on `index.html` and click `Open with Live Server`
4. Your default browser will open with the solar system running

### Method 2: Using Python HTTP Server

> Make sure Python is installed

`# For Python 3
python -m http.server 8000`
